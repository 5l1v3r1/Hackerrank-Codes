'''
Short Problem Definition:
Marie invented a Time Machine and wants to test it by time-traveling to visit Russia on the Day of the Programmer (the 256th day of the year) during a year in the inclusive range from 1700 to 2700.

Day of The Programmer ( https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/day-of-the-programmer/problem )

Complexity:
time complexity is O(-1)

space complexity is O(-1)

Execution:
As I have pointed out in the past, no engineer should ever implement any calendar related functions. It should be done natively by the language or by a library.

I am fairly certain that the conventions will change by 2700 ðŸ™‚ and the calculation will be invalid.

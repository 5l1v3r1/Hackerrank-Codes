'''
Here is a sample line of code that can be executed in Python:
print("Hello, World!")
You can just as easily store a string as a variable and then print it to stdout:
my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string)

Now try it youreself to print the following in the console.
Hello, World!

Below is the working solution
'''
def hello_world():      #Function to print the text
    print('Hello, World!')

if __name__=="__main__":
    hello_world()       #using the function in the code
